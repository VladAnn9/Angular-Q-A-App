# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/VladAnn9/Angular-Q-A-App.git
    
Then we need to install all packages:

    cd Angular-Q-A-App
    npm install
    
NPM 5 or above has the big advantage that if you use it you will be installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run our application, we will use the Angular CLI:

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli 
    
After CLI has been installed, we can just run our server:

    ng serve
    
he application is visible at port 4200: (http://localhost:4200)
